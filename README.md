# Material simulation environment
Material simulation environment provide a set of tools and packages to 
setup, manage, (pre/post)-process DFT calculations. It interfaces with
SLURM based HPC cluster to submit the jobs efficiently and in a semi-automatized fashion.

## Features
1.  Supported DFT codes: GPAW and VASP.
2.  K-points and Energy cut convergence.
3.  Relaxation or static type of DFT calculation.
4.  User defined workflows.
